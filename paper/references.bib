Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",

publisher="Springer Berlin Heidelberg",
address="Berlin, Heidelberg",
pages="692--706",
abstract="Constraint propagation solvers interleave propagation, removing impossible values from variable domains, with search. The solver state is modified during propagation. But search requires the solver to return to a previous state. Hence a propagation solver must determine how to maintain state during propagation and forward and backward search. This paper sets out the possible ways in which a propagation solver can choose to maintain state, and the restrictions that such choices place on the resulting system. Experiments illustrate the result of various choices for the three principle state components of a solver: variables, propagators, and dependencies between them. This paper also provides the first realistic comparison of trailing versus copying for state restoration.",

abstract = "The purpose of this paper is to show how the introduction of new primitive constraints (e.g., among, diffn, cycle) over finite domains in the constraint logic programming system CHIP result in finding very rapidly good solutions for a large class of difficult sequencing, scheduling, geometrical placement and vehicle routing problems. The among constraint allows us to specify sequencing constraints in a very concise way. For the first time, the diffn constraint allows us to express and to solve directly multi-dimensional placement problems, where one has to consider nonoverlapping constraints between n-dimensional objects (e.g., rectangles, parallelepipeds). The cycle constraint makes it possible to specify a wide range of graph partitioning problems that could not yet be expressed by using current constraint logic programming languages. One of the main advantages of all these new primitives is to take into account more globally a set of elementary constraints. Finally, we point out that all the previous primitive constraints enhance the power of the CHIP system significantly, allowing us to solve real life problems that were not within reach of constraint technology before."

abstract="Recent work in model combinators, as well as projects like G12 and SIMPL, achieved significant progress in automating the generation of complex and hybrid solvers from high-level model specifications. This paper extends model combinators into the scheduling domain. This is of particular interest as, today, both Constraint Programming (CP) and Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) perform well on scheduling problems providing different capabilities and trade-offs. The ability to construct hybrid scheduling solvers to leverage the strengths of both technologies as well as multiple problem encodings through high-level model combinators provides new opportunities. Complex parallel hybrids can be synthesized with minimal effort on the part of the user and provide substantial performance benefits over standalone solvers.",

abstract="The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a challenging optimization problem for CP and OR that has many industrial applications. Its generalization to the degree constrained minimum spanning tree problem (DCMSTP) is being intensively studied by the OR community. In particular, classical solution techniques for the TSP are being progressively generalized to the DCMSTP. Recent work on cost-based relaxations has improved CP models for the TSP. However, CP search strategies have not yet been widely investigated for these problems. The contributions of this paper are twofold. We first introduce a natural generalization of the weighted cycle constraint (WCC) to the DCMSTP. We then provide an extensive empirical evaluation of various search strategies. In particular, we show that significant improvement can be achieved via our graph interpretation of the state-of-the-art Last Conflict heuristic.",

abstract="Constraint solvers are complex pieces of software and are notoriously difficult to debug. In large part this is due to the difficulty of pinpointing the source of an error in the vast searches these solvers perform, since the effect of an error may only come to light long after the error is made. In addition, an error does not necessarily lead to the wrong result, further complicating the debugging process. A major source of errors in a constraint solver is the complex constraint propagation algorithms that provide the inference that controls and directs the search. In this paper we show that metamorphic testing is a principled way to test constraint solvers by comparing two different implementations of the same constraint. Specifically, specialised propagators for the constraint are tested against the general purpose table constraint propagator. We report on metamorphic testing of the constraint solver Minion. We demonstrate that the metamorphic testing method is very effective for finding artificial bugs introduced by random code mutation.",

abstract="The circuit constraint is used to constrain a graph represented by a successor for each node, such that the resulting edges form a circuit. Circuit and its variants are important for various kinds of tour-finding, path-finding and graph problems. In this paper we examine how to integrate the circuit constraint, and its variants, into a lazy clause generation solver. To do so we must extend the constraint to explain its propagation. We consider various propagation algorithms for circuit and examine how best to explain each of them. We compare the effectiveness of each propagation algorithm once we use explanation, since adding explanation changes the trade-off between propagation complexity and power. Simpler propagators, although less powerful, may produce more reusable explanations. Even though the most powerful propagator considered for circuit and variants creates huge explanations, we find that explanation is highly advantageous for solving problems involving this kind of constraint.",
